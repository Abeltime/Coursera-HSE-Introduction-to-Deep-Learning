# Getting deeper with Keras


# Description
- Tensorflow is a powerful and flexible tool, but coding large neural architectures with it is tedious.
- There are plenty of deep learning toolkits that work on top of it like Slim, TFLearn, Sonnet, Keras.
- Choice is matter of taste and particular task
- We'll be using Keras

# Goal
build DNN via Keras

# File Description
- `.ipynb` file is the solution of Week 2 program assignment 3
  - `Keras-task.ipynb`
- `.html` file is the html version of `.ipynb` file.
  - `Keras-task.html`
- `.py` python verson
  - `Keras-task.py`
- `.zip` of `md` file
  - `Keras-task.zip`
- file
  - `Keras-task`

# Snapshot
- **Recommend** read `.ipynb` file via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
- open `md` in file `Keras-task`
- open `.html` file via brower for quick look.
